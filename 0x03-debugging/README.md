# Welcome to ALX Low Level Programming
## 0x03. C - Debugging
### Tasks
0. [Multiple mains](https://github.com/gama1221/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging/0-main.c.c)
	- In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
1. [ Like, comment, subscribe](https://github.com/gama1221/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging/1-main.c)
    - Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

        - Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
        - You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task
2. [0 > 972?](https://github.com/gama1221/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging/2-largest_number.c)
    - This program prints the largest of three integers.
3. [Leap year](https://github.com/gama1221/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c)
    - This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
